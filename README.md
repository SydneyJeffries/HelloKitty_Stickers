This is a small project that gave me joy creating. I had two goals with this project other then polishing my own skills. 
The main goal was to create interactive art, and the secondary goal was to make it using best practices. It had to be created out of SVGs, be responsive to mobile and landscape mode, and coded neatly.
<p>
Before I started using Hello Kitty in my project I stretched my paralegal abilities and analyzed my legal rights of using her in my pleasure project. You can follow along with the rest of this read me if you're interested in my legal deduction of using copyrighted content, otherwise there is nothing left for you here. <p>

<h3> My deduction on the use of Copy-Righted Material </h3>
For those of you who are not aware, copywrite material when used in certain use cases is considered "fair use". fair use is measured 
by 4 different elements. "elements" is a loose legal term used in the legal world that describes a phrase or concept 
that's evaluated when judging the applicability of law. 
I'll list the elemental words used in the court’s decision making and pair them with their extremes and explain which of the elements that the court usually 
leans favor toward when evaluating copywrite law infringement.
<p>

<h4>The Elements: <br> </h4>
Non-profit v. commercial <br>
Factual v. fictional <br>
Smaller bits of the whole product v. the entire work. 

<p>

<h4>Non-profit v. commercial <br> </h4>
when considering if a person has "fair use" over copyright content the courts lean in favor of the person using the copyrighted material if it’s of non-profit. So if you’re using copyrighted material for pure pleasure and you’re not making money with it, the law is on your side and the law allows you to enjoy that copyrighted content as much as you’d like. copyrighted material is intended to protect the owner of the copywrite from loosing their ability to make profit from their product. So, as long as my Hello Kitty is not preventing Sanrio (the copywrite owner) from making profits, this is in my favor. I could even argue that I'm promoting her, thus increasing sales 
of Saniro products. But there are cases where the product could be argued as defamed thus possibly de-valuing the product, such as in Parody songs. (The court has traditionally waved in favor of parody music!) So wither or not you make money as a result of using the copyrighted product is not going to directly determine whether you violated 
copywrite law.  

<h4>Factual v. fictional<br> </h4>
In general, factual content such as law books, research, or anything that is a product of teaching the masses has looser copywrighted protections.
Hello kitty is a fictional character so it has stronger copy write protections, but this element is only one of 3 that is considered when weighing the protection of the copywrite. 
the court will look at all the elements and weigh the total outcome when determining who wins in a copywrite case. It's also notable that certain elements carry more weight then others.  

<h4>Smaller bits of the whole product v. the entire work. <br> </h4>
So, have you ever heard that you can use any song you'd like in your product if it's under a certain amount of time? Yeah, this is the part of the law that determined that free-bee. 
Just don't use the whole song. 

If you’re apart of an establishment that has enough assets to loose, and you need help determining more about fair use exceptions of copyrighted material, then definitely contact an attorney.  As a trained paralegal I legally can't give advice nor did I give you enough comprehensive information to determine your situation. These are "guidelines".
